# Spotify Music Analysis 2023
The following project is an analysis of the most streamed songs in the year 2023. The project identifies key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total streams, Number of tracks and the average streams. The project intergrates the use of Power BI, through which I've been able to come up with a visualization dashboard that can be used to determine the most streamed track, and also determine the top 5 most streamed tracks during the year 2023. Morover, the visualization determines the daily streams for all tracks, tracks and streams by month, and streams by release date.
